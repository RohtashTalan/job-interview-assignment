/* Description:

Create a frontend application (in any javascript framework) for logins and listing items stored in a database.
Only those users can log in to the application that exists in our DB. And, after logging list all product items in tabular format with pagination.
Users can select the product and it can store in session. So, they can get them once they are logged in back.

Tech Stack:
PHP for Building Rest APIs (if not familiar with PHP then create APIs in Node.js)
Any Javascript framework to build a frontend application. Vue.js preferable.
The database would be MongoDB
